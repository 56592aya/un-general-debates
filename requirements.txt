# The requirements in this file will be installed with `pip` when running
# `make requirements`. Some additional packages that are required for certain
# parts of this analysis are:
#
#   `tensorflow`: Installation is different depending on if you're training on
#   a GPU or not. Additionally, performance is better when installing through
#   `conda` instead of `pip`.
#
#   `faiss`: This is a similarity search module from FAIR. It's easily
#   installable through `conda`, but not through `pip`.
